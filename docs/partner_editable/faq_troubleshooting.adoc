== FAQ
*Q.* How do I output Duo Network Gateway Docker logs to a file?

*A.* To export the logs, SSH into the Duo Network Gateway (DNG) server and run the following command. You may need to replace the example DNG YML name with your current file's actual name:

`+docker-compose -p network-gateway -f network-gateway-1.5.5.yml logs > Dng.log+`

This will now export everything to a Dng.log file outside of your Docker Container. Once you are done exporting your logs you can cancel the log by pressing *Ctrl + C*.

*Q.* Can I bulk-create web applications for Duo Network Gateway?

*A.* Yes. You can configure Duo Network Gateway (DNG) using a configuration file so that you can bulk-create web applications, store your settings locally in source control, automatically deploy, and make changes to Duo Network Gateway without having to access the Admin console.

Please see the documentation: https://duo.com/docs/dng-scripted-config[Scripted Configuration for Duo Network Gateway^].

*Q.* How do I determine the current version number of the Duo Network Gateway?

*A.* To determine the current version number of the Duo Network Gateway, log into the Duo Network Gateway Admin Console and check the footer:

*Q.* How to interpret and troubleshoot Duo Network Gateway issues.

*A.* Please see the https://help.duo.com/s/article/dng-issues-guide?language=en_US[official Duo Security Knowledge Base^] for a list of common error messages with their meaning and resolution. 

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].
