// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/vjaWP[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/VwgQP[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.

As an additional deployment option, you can upload a scripted configuration file for {partner-product-name} at the time of deployment. This file must be generated according to https://duo.com/docs/dng-scripted-config[Duo documentation^]. Once created, the file must be uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket and specified during deployment using the 'ConfigYAMLPath' parameter. Typically, the scripted configuration option is used in automated workflows and command-line or programmatic methods of deploying this Quick Start. This supported scripted configuration is different than the scripted backup and restore feature, which is also supported by {partner-product-name}.
