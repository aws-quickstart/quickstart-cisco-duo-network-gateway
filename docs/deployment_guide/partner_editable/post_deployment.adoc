== Postdeployment steps

After the Partner Solution has been successfully created, you can interact with {partner-product-name} from a web browser. Perform the following steps:

. In a browser, navigate to https://<URL-of-the-network-gateway-load-balancer>:8443 from a network in the 'AdminServerRemoteAccessCIDR' subnet, and log in to the {partner-product-name} admin console. Your browser warns you about an untrusted certificate the first time you access the page. Dismiss the warning and continue to the page. 
. On the first page of the {partner-product-name} configuration screen, choose a password for the {partner-product-name} admin console. After entering a password that meets the requirements, choose *Save* and *Continue*.

[start=3]
. On the *Make {partner-product-name} visible to the internet* page, either fill in the fields, as shown in the following image, or choose the *Already have a {partner-product-name} configuration file? Import it now* link to import a configuration file.

Note the following recommendations when filling in the fields:

* As this Partner Solution uses load balancers that present SSL security to end users, you can use a certificate for the connection between the load balance and {partner-product-name}. There are two options for providing this certificate:
** If you want to provide your own SSL certificate for {partner-product-name}, choose *Change Certificate* and select *Provide my own certificate*. 
** If you want to use self-signed certificates for the {partner-product-name} server, choose the *Present a self-signed certificate to incoming connections* option.
* After selecting the *This {partner-product-name} is accessed through load balancers* check box, specify the internal IP addresses of your {partner-product-name} portal server load balancer, which you can locate in the *Outputs* section of the Partner Solution. This setting makes the {partner-product-name} aware of the load balancer IP addresses, which allows the source client IP addresses to log information, apply allowed IP restrictions, and pass IP addresses to protected applications.
* Be sure to provide complete and accurate information on this page to avoid errors with the initial configuration. If an error occurs, you will need to re-enter the information again before proceeding, including selecting the certificate and key. 
* When you choose *Save and Continue*, you are redirected to the {partner-product-name} admin console, where you can add a SAML authentication source and configure {partner-product-name} to proxy the applications for adding Duo policies.

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

The Partner Solution exposes two user-configurable security group access parameters: 'AdminServerRemoteAccessCIDR' and 'PortalServerRemoteAccessCIDR'. Be sure that the 'AdminServerRemoteAccessCIDR' parameter 'is accessible only on authorized network ranges for both ports 22 and 8443, not widely accessible on the internet.
